# Environment Setup
The file [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) contains the pre-requisites that are needed to enable a clean run of the scripts. Below is how to setup the environment:
```bash
virtualenv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# To Replicate SlimPajama
If you wish to reproduce our dataset, you can either follow our [Step-by-step Guide](#step-by-step-guide) or run the following command:
```bash
python main.py <prefix_path>/RedPajama/
```
It took ~2.5 days to process the 1.21T token RedPajama dataset on a machine with 64 CPU cores, but note that using [main.py](./main.py) will take longer as it doesn't parallelize some steps across the data chunks. The highest RAM consumption that we observed was ~1.4TB.

# Step-by-step Guide
Our pre-processing pipeline consists of multiple stages such as NFC normalization, cleaning, deduplication, document interleaving, 
document shuffling, split into train and holdout sets, deduplication of train set against holdout. 
All these steps are presented in the diagram below. 
Additional steps such as tokenization, sequence packing and sequence-level shuffling can be performed using our scripts located
at [hdf5_preprocessing](../scripts/hdf5_preprocessing/) and [hdf5_shuffling](../scripts/hdf5_shuffling/). 
All steps here assume that the whole dataset cannot fit in the available RAM and distributed across multiple processes. 
We are welcoming any additional datasets preparation steps or suggestions on how to make this even more efficient on the large scale datasets!

Note: every step produces a transformed version of the dataset. Be sure to provision enough disk space or actively delete intermediate versions!

## Step 1: NFC Normalization 
To remove non unicode characters we apply NFC normalization 
so that letters followed by combining characters become single combined characters (following [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)). 

Here is an example command to run NFC normalization: 
```bash
python preprocessing/normalize_text.py --data_dir <prefix_path>/RedPajama/arxiv/ --target_dir <prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/arxiv/
```
To reduce the total processing time, multiple jobs can be run for each corpus in parallel. For example, distribute the data files into multiple sub-directories, then replace `<prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/arxiv/` with `<prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/arxiv/<subfolder>` instead.

> NOTE: for dataset files in `.jsonl.zst` format (like common_crawl), please include the flag `--zst`.

## Step 2: Filter Short Documents
We found 1.86% of RedPajama's source documents contained improperly downloaded or low-length contents that we did not consider useful to include in the training data.
After removing punctuation, space symbols, newlines and tabs, we filtered out documents with less than 200 characters.

Here is an example command to find documents that need to be filtered out:
```bash
python preprocessing/filter.py <prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/<dataset_name>/ <prefix_path>/RedPajama_filtered.pickle <n_docs> <dataset_name> <threshold>
```

## Step 3: Deduplication 
To perform global dataset deduplication (within and between corpora), we used the [datasketch](http://ekzhu.com/datasketch/minhash.html) library and applied further optimizations to reduce memory consumption and increase parallelism. Our implementation is using producer-consumer schema in order to parallelize I/O operations that dominate our runtime. 
In addition, we applied code changes to reduce the memory utilization by keeping only one document per set of duplicates in memory.
To the best of our knowledge this the first open-sourced deduplication library written in Python that can process Trillion token datasets.
The deduplication process includes multiple stages such as building MinHashLSH index, performing querying into the index to locate duplicates, building a graph representation to locate connected components with duplicates and finally filtering duplicates in each component.
Below you can find commands to reproduce each step in the pipeline as well as parameters that we pre-processed SlimPajama dataset with. 

### Step 3.1: MinHash Generation
MinHash generation can be a very slow process. We recommend running it separately before creating a MinHashLSH index. 
To calculate MinHash object for each document, we strip, lowercase, remove punctuation, consecutive spaces, newlines and tabs from each document.
Afterwards, we construct a list of 13-grams that are later used as features to create a document signature to add into MinHashLSH
index. More details about MinHash can be found at [Identifying and Filtering Near-Duplicate Documents](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs253/papers/nearduplicate.pdf).

Here is an example command to run MinHash generation: 
```bash
python dedup/to_hash.py <dataset_name> <prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/<dataset_name>/ <prefix_path>/RedPajama_minhash/<dataset_name>/ <n_docs> <iter> <index_start> <index_end> -w <ngram_size> -k <buffer_size>
```
Similarly to NFC normalization, you can run multiple jobs in parallel for each corpus if you wish.

### Step 3.2: Duplicate Pairs Generation 
In this step, we build a MinHashLSH index and query it to locate near duplicates [Chapter 3, Mining of Massive Datasets](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3.pdf). We are using Jaccard similarity threshold of 0.8
to determine whether a pair of documents should be considered as a duplicate. Our implementation is using `--range` and `--bands` arguments that can be 
calculated with [datasketch/lsh.py](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch/blob/master/datasketch/lsh.py#L22) given a Jaccard threshold. We find 
aggressive deduplication the most efficient, but you can change the parameters below in order to reduce the amount of filtered content. 
```bash
python dedup/generate_duplicate_pairs.py --input_dir <prefix_path>/RedPajama_minhash/ --out_file <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates/duplicate_pairs.txt --range <range> --bands <bands> --processes <n_processes>
```
Note: This step consumed 1.4TB of memory for the 1.21T token RedPajama dataset. If you cannot access an instance with enough memory for your use case, this step will need to be split up further. We experimented with splitting the LSH object into multiple 
buckets to reduce memory consumption. This strategy should be easy to implement given the organization of our scripts.

> NOTE: total number of processes that will be created is `<n_processes>` + `<bands>`

### Step 3.3: Duplicate Graph Construction & Search for Connected Components 
After locating duplicate pairs, we need to find connected components containing documents that are duplicates with each other. To make it more illustrative, consider 
these pairs: `(A, B), (A, C), (A, E)`. We are going to form a cluster of `(A, B, C, E)` and keep only one document from the component. 

We evaluated the performance and memory consumption of [networkx](https://networkx.org/), [graphtool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/), and [networkit](https://networkit.github.io/). [networkit](https://networkit.github.io/) offered most efficient implementation as it is designed to work with large graphs and features great parallelism.

Below you can find an example command how to construct a graph from documents pairs: 
```bash
python dedup/generate_connected_components.py --input_dir <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates --out_file <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates/connected_components.pickle
```

### Step 3.4: Generate Final List of Duplicates 
Finally, we need to process the connected components and create a lookup table so we can filter out duplicates later. 

Below you can find an example command on how to generate a list of duplicates: 
```bash
python dedup/generate_duplicates_dict.py --input_file <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates/connected_components.pickle --out_file <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates/duplicates.pickle 
```

## Step 4: Interleave & Shuffle
Before we can train a model on the multi-sourced dataset we need to mix the sources together 
with specified weights. For SlimPajama we sample 1 epoch from each corpus, but you can easily update the sampling weights located in [preprocessing/datasets.py](preprocessing/datasets.py). 
This stage is also I/O bound and our implementation follows a producer-consumer schema.

An example command on how to run this step is provided below:
```bash
python preprocessing/shuffle_holdout.py pass1 --input_dir <prefix_path>/RedPajama_norm/ --duplicates <prefix_path>/redpj_duplicates/duplicates.pickle --short_docs <prefix_path>/RedPajama_filtered.pickle --out_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/pass1
```
In addition to mixing the sources, we also perform shuffling to avoid any ordering bias.
We follow [the-pile](https://github.com/EleutherAI/the-pile) 2-pass shuffling algorithm implementation [how-to-shuffle-a-big-dataset](https://blog.janestreet.com/how-to-shuffle-a-big-dataset/) and adopt it SlimPajama. 

## Step 5: Split Dataset into Train and Holdout
During this step we finish 2-pass shuffling and create a holdout set. 
To speed up the process, we split the source data into chunks and process them in parallel.
An example command is provided below: 
```bash
for j in {1..20}
do
    python preprocessing/shuffle_holdout.py pass2 "$((j-1))" "$j" "$j" --input_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/pass1 --train_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train --holdout_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/holdout > $j.log 2>&1 &
done
```

## Step 6: Deduplicate Train against Holdout
The final step is to make sure that there is no overlap between the train and holdout sets. This is important to ensure unbiased decision regarding your model's behaviour. To decontaminate our training set, we apply the SHA256 hashing algorithm to find exact matches between train and holdout sets. Then we filter the exact matches from the training set. Example command is provided below:  
```bash
python dedup/dedup_train.py 1 --src_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train --tgt_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/holdout --out_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train_deduped
for j in {2..20}
do
    python dedup/dedup_train.py "$j" --src_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train --tgt_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/holdout --out_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train_deduped > $j.log 2>&1 &
done
```
Steps [5](#step-5-split-dataset-into-train-and-holdout) & [6](#step-6-deduplicate-train-against-holdout) can be further applied to split holdout set into test and eval. 
For SlimPajama, decontaminated train, validation, and test sets are already available in our HuggingFace repo: [SlimPajama-627B](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B). 

# Splitting SlimPajama dataset based on its sources
SlimPajama consists of documents that comes from 7 different sources: `ArXiv`, `Book`, `C4`, `CommonCrawl`, `Github`, `StackExchange`, and `Wikipedia`. If you want to experiment with with different ratios for each data source, then you can either perform the steps in [Step-by-step Guide](#step-by-step-guide) with modifying [Step 4](#step-4-interleave--shuffle) to only deduplicate the dataset without interleaving the different data sources, or you can perform a post-processing on [SlimPajama](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B) with the script [split_dataset.py](./split_dataset.py) using the following command:
```bash
python split_dataset.py --input_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama/train --output_dir <prefix_path>/SlimPajama_split/train --processes <n_processes>
```
This will create a sub-directory for each data source in the output directory contains documents from this specific source.

> NOTE: total number of processes that will be created is `<n_processes>` + `7`, where `7` is the number of consumer processes for each data source and `<n_processes>` is the number of producer processes that needs to be at least `1`.
